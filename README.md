# Ava - Artificial Virtual Assistant	
This Python script utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 model, speech recognition, and text-to-speech capabilities to create a voice-controlled AI assistant. Here's how it works:

Getting Started
Set Up OpenAI API Key: Replace "INSERT-API-KEY-HERE" with your actual OpenAI API key.

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install openai pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition

Initialize Text-to-Speech Engine: The script uses the pyttsx3 library to convert text into speech. Make sure you have it installed.

How to Use
Run the script, and it will wait for your voice command to start.

Say "Hey GPT" to initiate the assistant.

Once you hear "Recording your question..." prompt, ask your question or provide input.

The assistant will record your voice, transcribe it, and send it to OpenAI's GPT-3 for generating a response.

The response from GPT-3 will be displayed on the screen and spoken aloud by the assistant.

The conversation continues until you exit the script.

Customization
You can adjust the max_tokens and temperature parameters in the generate_response function to control the length and creativity of GPT-3's responses.

Modify the timeout values for both listening phases to control how long the assistant waits for a command and how long it listens to your question.

Important Notes
Ensure you have an active internet connection to use the OpenAI API.

The script saves your voice input in an "input.wav" file and reads from it. You may want to adjust the filename or file management logic as needed.

Experiment with the speech recognition settings and speech synthesis voices to improve accuracy and voice quality.

Dependencies
